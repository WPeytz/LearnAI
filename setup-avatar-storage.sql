-- Setup Supabase Storage for Avatar Uploads
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor

-- Create the avatars bucket (if it doesn't exist)
-- Note: You may need to create this in the Supabase Dashboard > Storage instead
-- Go to Storage > Create a new bucket called "avatars"
-- Make it public so avatars can be viewed by everyone

-- After creating the bucket in the UI, run these policies:

-- Allow anyone to view avatars (public read)
CREATE POLICY "Avatar images are publicly accessible"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow users to update their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow users to delete their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
